Those protections include a cap of 36 percent on the Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) as well as other limitations on what lenders can charge for payday and other consumer loans. Contact your local Judge Advocate Generalâ€™s (JAG) office to learn more about lending restrictions. You can use the JAG Legal Assistance Office locator to find help.
