I heard that taking out a payday loan can help rebuild my credit or improve my credit score. Is this true?
Probably not. Payday loans generally are not reported to the three major national credit reporting companies, so they are unlikely to impact your credit scores.
Most storefront payday lenders do not consider traditional credit reports or credit scores when determining loan eligibility. They also do not generally report any information about payday loan borrowing history to the nationwide credit reporting companies.
